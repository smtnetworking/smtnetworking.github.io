## Twelve-Tone Music

- [10.3: Christoph Neidhöfer, "Directionality in Twelve-Tone Composition"](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/10_3_Neidhofer.html) - explores how one 12-tone composer, Julius Schloss, strategically arranged his serial materials to invoke tonal procedures like cadences and phrase structures; suitable for post-tonal music theory courses as well as classes addressing phrase structure, tonal direction, and cadence

- [3.2: J. Daniel Jenkins, “Schoenberg’s ‘Advice for Beginners in Composition with Twelve Tones’”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/3_2_Jenkins.html) – shows how Arnold Schoenberg teaches how to generate inversionally combinatorial twelve-tone rows, drawing from his pre-broadcast sketches; suitable for post-tonal music theory courses; demonstrates how one might use an archive in a music theoretical context

- [5.1–5.3: Joshua Banks Mailman, “Babbitt’s Beguiling Surfaces, Improvised Inside”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/5_123_Mailman.html) – discusses Babbitt’s compositional techniques (specifically partial ordering) and connects these techniques to improvisation (including jazz); suitable for students studying 20th-century compositional techniques
