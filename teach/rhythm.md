- [9.3: Rachel Short, “Interactions Between Music and Dance in Two Musical Theater Tap Breaks”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/volume9.html#interactions-between-music-and-dance-in-two-musical-theater-tap-breaks) – explores scenarios where metrical patterns in music and dance conflict (metric dissonance); suitable for students at all levels, ranging from introducing musical meter and its elements to advanced study of metric dissonance

- [9.1: Chelsea Oden, “‘We are dancing, We are flying’: The Feeling of Flight in Dance Scenes from Recent Popular Film”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/volume9.html#we-are-dancing-we-are-flying-the-feeling-of-flight-in-dance-scenes-from-recent-popular-film) – discusses visual, metrical, and timbral aspects of dance scenes in film; introduces the distinction between duple, triple, simple, and compound meters in an embodied context, suitable for music fundamentals and beginning students; introduces the “sound envelope” (ADSR) and connects timbre to embodied experiences, suitable for students at all levels developing a vocabulary for describing timbre

- [8.6: Ben Duinker, “When Hip-Hop Accents Collide (They Create Syncopation)”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/volume8.html#when-hip-hop-accents-collide-they-create-syncopation) – discusses the distinctive accent patterns at different levels of a hip-hop track (lyrics, delivery, and accompaniment) and discusses potential meanings of syncopation in this repertoire; suitable for students at all levels learning about rhythm and meter, syncopation, metric dissonance, and text-music relationships

- [7.2: Kara Yoo Leaman, “Dance as Music in George Balanchine’s Concerto Barocco”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/volume7.html#dance-as-music-in-george-balanchines-concerto-barocco) – addresses conflicting patterns in music and choreography and connects this metric dissonance to a melodic motive in Bach; suitable for students at all levels, especially study of metric dissonance

- [2.1: Harald Krebs, “The Influence of Clara Schumann’s Lieder on Declamation in Robert Schumann’s Late Songs”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/volume2.html#the-influence-of-clara-schumanns-lieder-on-declamation-in-robert-schumanns-late-songs) – This video could be used to teach several rhythm and meter topics. The main focus of the video is on the differences between poetic rhythm and Schumann's music-metrically irregular settings of these text-metrically regular poems. Teaching topics that may come up include Lerdahl/Jackendoff dot arrays, hypermetric numberings, and recompositional analysis; the video could also be used to talk about text-music relationships (especially in terms of expressive meaning), or in a discussion of historical questions about influence.
