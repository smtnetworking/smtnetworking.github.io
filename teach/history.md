- [11.5 William O’Hara, “Between Art and Science: Amy Beach’s ‘Hermit Thrush’ Pieces and Early-Twentieth-Century Birdsong Transcription”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/11_5_Ohara.html) – analyzes Amy Beach’s use of birdsong transcriptions in her piano work “Hermit Thrush at Eve,” demonstrating Beach’s nuanced understanding of harmony and her engagement with early-twentieth-century debates about transcription, graphic notation, and the relationship between birdsong and human music-making.
  
- [11.3: Daphne Tan, Alexis Millares Thomson, Tegan Ridge, and Emma Soldaat, "Tessellated Tonics: Zuckerkandl’s Toy for Music Fundamentals"](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/11_3_Tan_etal.html) - brings to life a mid-20th-century device for learning music fundamentals that was invented by the music theorist Victor Zuckerkandl; connects this pedagogical device to manipulatives in mathematics education; suitable for students at all levels studying keys and key signatures, intervals, and modulation, as well as for those with an interest in music-theoretical abstraction.

- [10.6: Liam Hynes-Tawa, "Japanese Tetrachordal Theory in Settings Old and New"](http://www.smt-v.org/archives/10_6_Hynes-Tawa.html) - Introduces a fourth-based framework for pitch analysis in contrast to more familiar octave-based ones, demonstrating both how it can be helpful for the Japanese folk music for which it was designed, and for other music in more modern genres; suitable for students learning about scales and modes, as a way of expanding how those categories can be conceptualized and used.
  
- [10.1: L. Poundie Burstein with Quynh Nguyen and Jennifer Roderer, "The Best Laid Plans . . . and Others: An 18th-Century Compositional Outline"](http://www.smt-v.org/archives/10_1_Burstein_Roderer_Nguyen.html) - explores how an 18th-century music theorist attempted to distinguish essential material from elaboration in a contemporary composition; would be suitable for the study of phrase structure and small forms, for considering melodic construction, and for exploring the history of music analysis
  
- [7.1: Stephanie Probst, “Music Appreciation Through Animation: Percy Scholes’s ‘AudioGraphic’ Piano Rolls”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/7_1_Probst.html) – discusses piano rolls with music-analytical overlay; includes a visual analysis of Bach’s B-flat major fugue from WTC I; suitable for introducing students to different visual models for analyzing form and for introducing fugue

- [3.2: J. Daniel Jenkins, “Schoenberg’s ‘Advice for Beginners in Composition with Twelve Tones’”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/3_2_Jenkins.html) – shows how Arnold Schoenberg teaches how to generate inversionally combinatorial twelve-tone rows, drawing from his pre-broadcast sketches; suitable for post-tonal music theory courses; demonstrates how one might use an archive in a music theoretical context

- [3.1: L. Poundie Burstein with Quynh Nguyen, “Parenthetic Aside in a 1789 Analysis of Mozart’s K. 284”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/3_1_Burstein_Nguyen.html) – introduces a historically informed way to understand the two-part exposition (the exposition with the secondary theme) in a Classical sonata form; suitable for upper-level music students and students composing a Classical-style sonata first movement; discusses performance implications of treating the secondary theme as a “middle passage”
