Poundie Burstein with Quynh Nguyen and Jennifer Roderer, "The Best Laid Plans . . . and Others: An 18th-Century Compositional Outline"](volume10.html#the-best-laid-plans-and-others-an-18th-century-compositional-outline) - explores how an 18th-century music theorist attempted to distinguish essential material from elaboration in a contemporary composition; would be suitable for the study of phrase structure and small forms, for considering melodic construction, and for exploring the history of music analysis
  
- [7.1: Stephanie Probst, “Music Appreciation Through Animation: Percy Scholes’s ‘AudioGraphic’ Piano Rolls”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/volume7.html#music-appreciation-through-animation-percy-scholess-audiographic-piano-rolls) – discusses piano rolls with music-analytical overlay; includes a visual analysis of Bach’s B-flat major fugue from WTC I; suitable for introducing students to different visual models for analyzing form and for introducing fugue

Daniel Jenkins, “Schoenberg’s ‘Advice for Beginners in Composition with Twelve Tones’”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/volume3.html#schoenbergs-advice-for-beginners-in-composition-with-twelve-tones) – shows how Arnold Schoenberg teaches how to generate inversionally combinatorial twelve-tone rows, drawing from his pre-broadcast sketches; suitable for post-tonal music theory courses; demonstrates how one might use an archive in a music theoretical context

- [3.1: L. Poundie Burstein with Quynh Nguyen, “Parenthetic Aside in a 1789 Analysis of Mozart’s K. 284”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/volume3.html#parenthetic-aside-in-a-1789-analysis-of-mozarts-k-284) – introduces a historically informed way to understand the two-part exposition (the exposition with the secondary theme) in a Classical sonata form; suitable for upper-level music students and students composing a Classical-style sonata first movement; discusses performance implications of treating the secondary theme as a “middle passage”
