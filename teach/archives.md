## Autographs and Archival Documents

- [11.5 William O’Hara, “Between Art and Science: Amy Beach’s ‘Hermit Thrush’ Pieces and Early-Twentieth-Century Birdsong Transcription”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/11_5_Ohara.html) – analyzes Amy Beach’s use of birdsong transcriptions in her piano work “Hermit Thrush at Eve,” demonstrating Beach’s nuanced understanding of harmony and her engagement with early-twentieth-century debates about transcription, graphic notation, and the relationship between birdsong and human music-making.

- [11.3: Daphne Tan, Alexis Millares Thomson, Tegan Ridge, and Emma Soldaat, "Tessellated Tonics: Zuckerkandl’s Toy for Music Fundamentals"](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/11_3_Tan_etal.html) - brings to life a mid-20th-century device for learning music fundamentals that was invented by the music theorist Victor Zuckerkandl; connects this pedagogical device to manipulatives in mathematics education; suitable for students at all levels studying keys and key signatures, intervals, and modulation, as well as for those with an interest in music-theoretical abstraction.
  
- [10.3: Christoph Neidhöfer, "Directionality in Twelve-Tone Composition"](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/10_3_Neidhoffer.html) - explores how one 12-tone composer, Julius Schloss, strategically arranged his serial materials to invoke tonal procedures like cadences and phrase structures; suitable for post-tonal music theory courses as well as classes addressing phrase structure, tonal direction, and cadence
  
- [10.1: L. Poundie Burstein with Quynh Nguyen and Jennifer Roderer, "The Best Laid Plans . . . and Others: An 18th-Century Compositional Outline"](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/10_1_Burstein_Roderer_Nguyen.html) - explores how an 18th-century music theorist attempted to distinguish essential material from elaboration in a contemporary composition; would be suitable for the study of phrase structure and small forms, for considering melodic construction, and for exploring the history of music analysis

- [9.5: Yi-Cheng Daniel Wu, "Poetry and Musical Organization in JIA Guoping’s The Wind Sounds in the Sky (2002)"](http://www.smt-v.org/archives/9_5_Wu.html) - shows how JIA Guoping derives his rhythmic structure from aspects of Chinese poetry; suitable for post-tonal music theory courses, discussions of text-music relations, and classes exploring cultural exchange

- [7.1: Stephanie Probst, “Music Appreciation Through Animation: Percy Scholes’s ‘AudioGraphic’ Piano Rolls”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/7_1_Probst.html) – discusses piano rolls with music-analytical overlay; includes a visual analysis of Bach’s B-flat major fugue from WTC I; suitable for introducing students to different visual models for analyzing form and for introducing fugue

- [4.2: Carmel Raz, “Anne Young’s Musical Games (1801): Music Theory, Gender, and Game Design”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/4_2_Raz.html) and [4.3: Carmel Raz, “Anne Young’s Introduction to Music (1803): Pedagogical, Speculative, and Ludic Music Theory”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/4_3_Raz.html) – discusses an educational board game for teaching music fundamentals and the connection to contemporary speculative music theory; suitable for students studying music and gender, the history of music theory, and music theory pedagogy

- [3.2: J. Daniel Jenkins, “Schoenberg’s ‘Advice for Beginners in Composition with Twelve Tones’”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/3_2_Jenkins.html) – shows how Arnold Schoenberg teaches how to generate inversionally combinatorial twelve-tone rows, drawing from his pre-broadcast sketches; suitable for post-tonal music theory courses; demonstrates how one might use an archive in a music theoretical context

- [1.3: Edward Klorman, “Multiple Agency in Mozart’s Chamber Music”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/1_3_Klorman.html) – Edward Klorman emphasizes how historical sources, including musical scores, can draw our attention to the social interplay among individual performers, or “personas enacted by the individual players” (4:38–41), within string quartets. Using an excerpt from the last movement of Mozart’s String Quartet in G Major, K. 387 (1782), as an example, Klorman illustrates his concept of “multiple agency,” a perspective that “celebrates the creative role of performers” and that yields “vivid analytical interpretations that can be masked by conventional, omniscient vantage points” (4:10–28). This video is suitable for students at all levels who would like to learn more about the socio-historical and -cultural dimensions of composition and performance. Basic knowledge of musical form and tonality are welcome but not necessary. For further reading, please see the author’s monograph *Mozart’s Music of Friends: Social Interplay in the Chamber Works* (Cambridge University Press, 2016) and Edward T. Cone’s *The Composer’s Voice* (University of California Press, 1974).
