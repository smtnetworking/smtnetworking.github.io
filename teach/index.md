# Teach with _SMT-V_!

SMT-V video-articles are designed to be accessible to students from the high school level, and many instructors of music theory have used our videos in their teaching all the way through the graduate level. 

Click here to find a list of SMT-V video-articles by pedagogical topic, and some ideas for using them in class!


### Rhythm and Meter

9.1: Chelsea Oden, “‘We are dancing, We are flying’: The Feeling of Flight in Dance Scenes from Recent Popular Film” – discusses visual, metrical, and timbral aspects of dance scenes in film; introduces the distinction between duple, triple, simple, and compound meters in an embodied context, suitable for music fundamentals and beginning students; introduces the “sound envelope” (ADSR) and connects timbre to embodied experiences, suitable for students at all levels developing a vocabulary for describing timbre

9.3: Rachel Short, “Interactions Between Music and Dance in Two Musical Theater Tap Breaks” – explores scenarios where metrical patterns in music and dance conflict (metric dissonance); suitable for students at all levels, ranging from introducing musical meter and its elements to advanced study of metric dissonance

8.6: Ben Duinker, “When Hip-Hop Accents Collide (They Create Syncopation)” – discusses the distinctive accent patterns at different levels of a hip-hop track (lyrics, delivery, and accompaniment) and discusses potential meanings of syncopation in this repertoire; suitable for students at all levels learning about rhythm and meter, syncopation, metric dissonance, and text-music relationships

7.2: Kara Yoo Leaman, “Dance as Music in George Balanchine’s Concerto Barocco” – addresses conflicting patterns in music and choreography and connects this metric dissonance to a melodic motive in Bach; suitable for students at all levels, especially study of metric dissonance

2.1: Harald Krebs, “The Influence of Clara Schumann’s Lieder on Declamation in Robert Schumann’s Late Songs” – This video could be used to teach several rhythm and meter topics. The main focus of the video is on the differences between poetic rhythm and Schumann's music-metrically irregular settings of these text-metrically regular poems. Teaching topics that may come up include Lerdahl/Jackendoff dot arrays, hypermetric numberings, and recompositional analysis; the video could also be used to talk about text-music relationships (especially in terms of expressive meaning), or in a discussion of historical questions about influence.

3.3: Stephen Rodgers, “Music, Poetry, and Performance in a Song by Maria Schneider” – introduces how poetic declamation and the sound of recitation might influence compositional decision and the performer’s interpretive choices; suitable for student singers and composers
