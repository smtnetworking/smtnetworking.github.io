- [12.1: Joon Park, "Calligraphic Listening: Making Sense of Hosokawa's Vertical Time"](http://www.smt-v.org/archives/12_1_Park.html) - This video introduces an interpretative strategy for Toshio Hosokawa’s composition Vertical Time Study I by treating composite sounds as sonic brushstrokes and the silence between them as a blank space where these strokes’ preparatory gestures take place; suitable for beginning music students and non‑music‑major students, as a way to introduce attentive listening habits, or for post‑tonal courses to complement pitch‑class set analysis.
  
- [10.6: Liam Hynes-Tawa, "Japanese Tetrachordal Theory in Settings Old and New"](http://www.smt-v.org/archives/10_6_Hynes-Tawa.html) - Introduces a fourth-based framework for pitch analysis in contrast to more familiar octave-based ones, demonstrating both how it can be helpful for the Japanese folk music for which it was designed, and for other music in more modern genres; suitable for students learning about scales and modes, as a way of expanding how those categories can be conceptualized and used.

- [8.1: Noriko Manabe: “Abe Road: Kuwata Keisuke’s Beatles Parody”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/8_1_Manabe.html) – illustrates how Kuwata used the subtleties of word sounds to create a parody album critical of the Japanese government

- [7.5: Adem Merter Birson, “Understanding Turkish Classical Makam: Identifying Modes Through Characteristic Melodies”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/7_5_Birson.html) – shows how melodic formulas underlie makam melodies, and how these formulas were obscured by the adaptation of the repertoire to Western staff notation

- [6.5: Aaron Carter-Ényì and Quintina Carter-Ényì, “Melodic Language and Linguistic Melodies: Text Setting in Ìgbò”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/6_5_Carter-Enyi_Carter-Enyi.html) – explores how tonal languages interact with text setting; discusses how missionaries failed to produce idiomatic translations of hymn tunes because they did not translate linguistic tones correctly
