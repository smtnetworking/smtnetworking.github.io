- 8.2: Scott Murphy: “Clara Schumann’s op. 16 no. 3 and ‘Fifth Above, Third Below’: Discerning Inverted Canonic Potential” – shows how to identify whether a subject can be treated in an inverted canon

- 2.1: Harald Krebs, “The Influence of Clara Schumann’s Lieder on Declamation in Robert Schumann’s Late Songs” – This video could be used to teach several rhythm and meter topics. The main focus of the video is on the differences between poetic rhythm and Schumann's music-metrically irregular settings of these text-metrically regular poems. Teaching topics that may come up include Lerdahl/Jackendoff dot arrays, hypermetric numberings, and recompositional analysis; the video could also be used to talk about text-music relationships (especially in terms of expressive meaning), or in a discussion of historical questions about influence.

- 5.4: Scott Murphy, “‘Fifth Above, Third Below’: Discerning Canonic Potential” – shows how to identify whether a subject can be treated in canon; considers examples from Clara Schumann; suitable for students of counterpoint at all levels
