- [11.6, Gilad Rabinovitch, “Reconstructing a Nineteenth-Century Fantasy](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/volume11.htmlvolume11.html#reconstructing-a-nineteenth-century-fantasy-between-model-composition-and-reimagining-improvisation): Between Model Composition and Reimagining Improvisation”: this video reports on the author’s creative reconstruction of a fantasy based on pedagogical materials in Carl Czerny’s Systematic Introduction to Improvisation Op. 200 (1983 [1829]); suitable for piano repertoire, form and analysis, music history, and performance practice courses.

- [11.3: Daphne Tan, Alexis Millares Thomson, Tegan Ridge, and Emma Soldaat, "Tessellated Tonics: Zuckerkandl’s Toy for Music Fundamentals"](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/volume11.html#tessellated-tonics-zuckerkandls-toy-for-music-fundamentals) - brings to life a mid-20th-century device for learning music fundamentals that was invented by the music theorist Victor Zuckerkandl; connects this pedagogical device to manipulatives in mathematics education; suitable for students at all levels studying keys and key signatures, intervals, and modulation, as well as for those with an interest in music-theoretical abstraction.

- [8.2: Scott Murphy: “Clara Schumann’s op. 16 no. 3 and ‘Fifth Above, Third Below’: Discerning Inverted Canonic Potential”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/volume8.html#clara-schumanns-op-16-no-3-and-fifth-above-third-below-discerning-inverted-canonic-potential) – shows how to identify whether a subject can be treated in an inverted canon

- [5.4: Scott Murphy, “‘Fifth Above, Third Below’: Discerning Canonic Potential”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/volume5.html#fifth-above-third-below-discerning-canonic-potential) – shows how to identify whether a subject can be treated in canon; considers examples from Clara Schumann; suitable for students of counterpoint at all levels

- [2.1: Harald Krebs, “The Influence of Clara Schumann’s Lieder on Declamation in Robert Schumann’s Late Songs”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/volume2.html#the-influence-of-clara-schumanns-lieder-on-declamation-in-robert-schumanns-late-songs) – This video could be used to teach several rhythm and meter topics. The main focus of the video is on the differences between poetic rhythm and Schumann's music-metrically irregular settings of these text-metrically regular poems. Teaching topics that may come up include Lerdahl/Jackendoff dot arrays, hypermetric numberings, and recompositional analysis; the video could also be used to talk about text-music relationships (especially in terms of expressive meaning), or in a discussion of historical questions about influence.
