## Global Musics

- [10.6: Liam Hynes-Tawa, "Japanese Tetrachordal Theory in Settings Old and New"](http://www.smt-v.org/archives/10_6_Hynes-Tawa.html) - Introduces a fourth-based framework for pitch analysis in contrast to more familiar octave-based ones, demonstrating both how it can be helpful for the Japanese folk music for which it was designed, and for other music in more modern genres; suitable for students learning about scales and modes, as a way of expanding how those categories can be conceptualized and used.
  
- [9.5: Yi-Cheng Daniel Wu, "Poetry and Musical Organization in JIA Guoping’s The Wind Sounds in the Sky (2002)"](http://www.smt-v.org/archives/9_5_Wu.html) - shows how JIA Guoping derives his rhythmic structure from aspects of Chinese poetry; suitable for post-tonal music theory courses, discussions of text-music relations, and classes exploring cultural exchange

- [7.5: Adem Merter Birson, “Understanding Turkish Classical Makam: Identifying Modes Through Characteristic Melodies”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/7_5_Birson.html) – shows how melodic formulas underlie makam melodies, and how these formulas were obscured by the adaptation of the repertoire to Western staff notation

- [6.5: Aaron Carter-Ényì and Quintina Carter-Ényì, “Melodic Language and Linguistic Melodies: Text Setting in Ìgbò”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/6_5_Carter-Enyi_Carter-Enyi.html) – explores how tonal languages interact with text setting; discusses how missionaries failed to produce idiomatic translations of hymn tunes because they did not translate linguistic tones correctly
