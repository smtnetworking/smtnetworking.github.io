- [11.4: Ben Geyer, "Improvising the Changes in a Miles Davis Rhythm Section"](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/11_4_Geyer.html) - explores the harmonic variety of improvised chords in “Bye, Bye Blackbird.” Provides a foil to classical conceptions of consonance/dissonance and harmonic function; can frame the study of jazz harmony or explore deeper possibilities in improvisation

- [11.1: Anabel Maler, ""Music as Movement in Signed Song: Analyzing Rosa Lee Timm’s ‘River Song""](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/11_1_Maler.html) - explores how musical parameters like vocal quality, melody, and rhythm can emerge in a visual-kinesthetic medium, without sound
  
- [8.6: Ben Duinker, “When Hip-Hop Accents Collide (They Create Syncopation)”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/8_6_Duinker.html) – discusses the distinctive accent patterns at different levels of a hip-hop track (lyrics, delivery, and accompaniment) and discusses potential meanings of syncopation in this repertoire; suitable for students at all levels learning about rhythm and meter, syncopation, metric dissonance, and text-music relationships

- [8.3: Nicholas Shea, “The Feel of the Guitar in Popular Music Performance”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/8_3_Shea.html) – shows how fretboard gestures help to demarcate musical form; provides an analytical framework rooted in popular music performance practice rather than “traditional” music theory

- [7.5: Adem Merter Birson, “Understanding Turkish Classical Makam: Identifying Modes Through Characteristic Melodies”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/7_5_Birson.html) – shows how melodic formulas underlie makam melodies, and how these formulas were obscured by the adaptation of the repertoire to Western staff notation

- [6.1: Cecilia Oinas, “Sensitivity, Intimacy, and Bodily Interaction in Kurtág’s Four-Handed Piano Works”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/6_1_Oinas.html) – explores the intimacy of hands-crossing gestures in four-hand piano music

- [6.3: Daniel Ketter, “Discovering Essential Voices in Johann Sebastian Bach’s Solo Instrumental Suite Movements”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/6_3_Ketter.html) – cello arrangements used to help students understand the contrapuntal structure of Bach’s solo music; see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yguQ1Q3kGB8&list=PLoDoWaIYcEP_bCYiTYBNnFwG2TypHrTDG and discussion in Headlam, “Music Informance: Performance for the Information Age” in the Oxford Handbook of Public Music Theory

- [5.1–5.3: Joshua Banks Mailman, “Babbitt’s Beguiling Surfaces, Improvised Inside”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/5_123_Mailman.html) – discusses Babbitt’s compositional techniques (specifically partial ordering) and connects these techniques to improvisation (including jazz); suitable for students studying 20th-century compositional techniques

- [3.1: L. Poundie Burstein with Quynh Nguyen, “Parenthetic Aside in a 1789 Analysis of Mozart’s K. 284”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/3_1_Burstein_Nguyen.html) – introduces a historically informed way to understand the two-part exposition (the exposition with the secondary theme) in a Classical sonata form; suitable for upper-level music students and students composing a Classical-style sonata first movement; discusses performance implications of treating the secondary theme as a “middle passage”

- [3.3: Stephen Rodgers, “Music, Poetry, and Performance in a Song by Maria Schneider”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/3_3_Rodgers.html) – introduces how poetic declamation and the sound of recitation might influence compositional decision and the performer’s interpretive choices; suitable for student singers and composers

- [1.3: Edward Klorman, “Multiple Agency in Mozart’s Chamber Music”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/1_3_Klorman.html) – emphasizes how historical sources, including musical scores, can draw our attention to the social interplay among individual performers, or “personas enacted by the individual players” (4:38–41), within string quartets. Using an excerpt from the last movement of Mozart’s String Quartet in G Major, K. 387 (1782), as an example, Klorman illustrates his concept of “multiple agency,” a perspective that “celebrates the creative role of performers” and that yields “vivid analytical interpretations that can be masked by conventional, omniscient vantage points” (4:10–28). This video is suitable for students at all levels who would like to learn more about the socio-historical and -cultural dimensions of composition and performance. Basic knowledge of musical form and tonality are welcome but not necessary. For further reading, please see the author’s monograph *Mozart’s Music of Friends: Social Interplay in the Chamber Works* (Cambridge University Press, 2016) and Edward T. Cone’s *The Composer’s Voice* (University of California Press, 1974).
