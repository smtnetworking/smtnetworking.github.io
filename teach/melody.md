- [10.6: Liam Hynes-Tawa, "Japanese Tetrachordal Theory in Settings Old and New"](http://www.smt-v.org/archives/volume10.html#japanese-tetrachordal-theory-in-settings-old-and-new) - Introduces a fourth-based framework for pitch analysis in contrast to more familiar octave-based ones, demonstrating both how it can be helpful for the Japanese folk music for which it was designed, and for other music in more modern genres; suitable for students learning about scales and modes, as a way of expanding how those categories can be conceptualized and used.
  
- [9.4: Nate Mitchell, “Variations on a Theme by K.K. Slider: Variation Sets and the Hourly Music of Animal Crossing: New Horizons”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/volume9.html#variations-on-a-theme-by-k-k-slider-memory-and-play-in-animal-crossing-new-horizons) – treats the soundtrack of Animal Crossing: New Horizons as a modern example of theme and variations form; suitable for introducing theme and variations at all levels

- [7.4: Michael Buchler, “I Don’t Care if I Never Get Back: Optimism and Ascent in ‘Take Me Out to The Ball Game’”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/volume7.html#i-dont-care-if-i-never-get-back-optimism-and-ascent-in-take-me-out-to-the-ball-game) – analyzes the melodic structure and phrase structure of the verse of “Take Me Out to the Ball Game” to contextualize the melodic ascent of the better-known chorus; suitable for students at all levels learning about cadences, phrase structure, and melodic norms, as well as for advanced students of linear analysis

- [7.5: Adem Merter Birson, “Understanding Turkish Classical Makam: Identifying Modes Through Characteristic Melodies”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/volume7.html#understanding-turkish-classical-makam-identifying-modes-through-characteristic-melodies) – shows how melodic formulas underlie makam melodies, and how these formulas were obscured by the adaptation of the repertoire to Western staff notation

- [6.3: Daniel Ketter, “Discovering Essential Voices in Johann Sebastian Bach’s Solo Instrumental Suite Movements”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/volume6.html#discovering-essential-voices-in-johann-sebastian-bachs-solo-instrumental-suite-movements) – suitable for teaching binary form (especially differences between Baroque and Classical binary form), paired with Brody, “Teaching Bach’s Binary Forms” (see bibliography); discusses how Bach implies distinct voices in his solo instrumental works; suitable for advanced students studying linear analysis (pairs well with Rothstein, “on Implied Tones”); see also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yguQ1Q3kGB8&list=PLoDoWaIYcEP_bCYiTYBNnFwG2TypHrTDG and discussion in Headlam, “Music Informance: Performance for the Information Age” in the Oxford Handbook of Public Music Theory

- [4.1: Christopher Doll, “Was it Diegetic, or Just a Dream? Music’s Paradoxical Place in the Film Inception”](https://www.smt-v.org/archives/volume4.html#was-it-diegetic-or-just-a-dream-musics-paradoxical-place-in-the-film-inception) – explains terms “diegetic,” “nondiegetic,” and “fantastical gap” as it relates to analysis of music in Inception (2010); shows interrelations between motives drawn from diegetic content used in Hans Zimmer’s film score, which serves both diegetic and nondiegetic functions; ideal for engaging analysis of film music and meaningful motivic relations
