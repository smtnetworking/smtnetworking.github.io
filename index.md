*Though we tend to perceive classical music as fixed “composers’ compositions,” historical music making and learning in Europe included a great deal of improvisation. This video reports on my creative reconstruction project: a reimagining of a fantasy latent in pedagogical fragments in Carl Czerny’s ([1829] 1983)* Systematic Introduction to Improvisation. *Czerny’s treatise is uniquely generous in documenting a variety of improvised genres, ranging from serious fantasies to light variations and potpourris on popular tunes. My reconstructed fantasy takes three written-out transformations of a hypothetical audience suggestion and uses them in a multi-movement sonata-fantasia. Though my project—as [recorded](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BPAdAqHGazScoPS7JHr-oRAThxjCb05N/view?usp=sharing) by pianist Bang-Shyuan Chen—is a composition, not an improvisation, it represents one of the many scholarly and musical paths towards reimagining historical practices. In addition to providing a background on improvisation in this period, I discuss two technical aspects associated with this project—motivic transformation and the large-scale organization of a sonata-fantasia.*
