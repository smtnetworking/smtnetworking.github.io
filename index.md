*This video explores the stylistic and associative evolution of the emblematic sound Aaron Copland forged in his _Fanfare for the Common Man_ (1942). This style, called here the _triumphant exordium_, consists of a constellation of specific musical features that has been imitated and troped by other composers—and by Copland himself—to carve out musical landscapes with evocative expressive qualities that include both clear and ambiguous connections with Americana. After summarizing the _Fanfare’s_ original musical and extra-musical contexts, this video illuminates this legacy through three case studies.*
