*Like many kids’ TV shows,* Bluey *frequently repurposes classical music. In designing* Bluey’s *soundscape, lead composer Joff Bush has frequently favored an end-oriented approach to revealing classical themes, engaging a formal process that productively interfaces with Peter Burkholder’s (1995) idea of thematic growth via cumulative form and Mark Spicer’s (2004) extension of the concept, textural growth via accumulative form. In this video, I generalize both kinds of growth into a holistic process of accumulation, and I show how Bush and his creative team often apply this process to support* Bluey’s *narrative goals. Three analytical vignettes demonstrate how* Bluey’s *audiences are often taken on a journey of discovery in the seven to nine minutes each episode encompasses—themes are initially hinted at, gradually assembled, and finally revealed in their full splendor at the episode’s narrative climax.*

*Music created and performed primarily in a visual-kinesthetic or tactile modality, such as signed music, presents important challenges for our existing methodologies and paradigms in the field of music theory. The existence of music that does not necessarily involve sounds prompts us to reconceptualize music in terms of organized movement, and to consider how musical parameters such as vocal quality, melody, and rhythm can emerge in a visual-kinesthetic musical medium. This video considers these parameters through a detailed analysis of the original signed song “River Song,” composed and performed by Rosa Lee Timm. The video uses music analysis and video interviews with Timm to reveal the meaning of a purely signed piece of music.*
