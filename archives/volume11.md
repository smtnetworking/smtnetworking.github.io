*Throughout her long career, American composer Amy Beach (1867–1944) engaged with birdsong in numerous ways. This video examines her use of transcribed birdcalls in the piano piece “Hermit Thrush at Eve” (1922). These transcriptions arose at a time when ornithologists were exploring the merits of traditional notation versus numerous graphical systems, leading to debates which not only anticipated the rise of graphic notation in the twentieth century, but contested the very nature of birdsong by means of its connection (or lack thereof) to human musical constructs like harmony and tonality. By analyzing the piece in the context of early-twentieth-century naturalism, I argue that Beach’s “Hermit Thrush at Eve” constitutes a compelling speculative exploration of how avian music intersects with human, and shows how artistic and scientific inquiry can inform one another.*

### Improvising the Changes in a Miles Davis Rhythm Section

*Individual musicians can make different chord choices in each pass through a tune’s form. This variability sometimes results in harmonic disagreement between musicians even as they play together. Harmony is a primary lens for understanding improvisation, but what kind of lens fluctuates in its prescription? To navigate this tension, this video turns to the jazz greats, exploring how pianist Red Garland and bassist Paul Chambers strike a balance between harmonic consistency and variation on Miles Davis’s recording of “Bye Bye Blackbird.” I treat their combined 14 choruses as a corpus—a selection of related examples analyzed for patterns—and find that they approach distinct “zones” within the tune in one of three ways: as “fixed,” “what-variable,” or “when-variable.” This framework motivates a modified lead sheet that captures not only the tune’s moments of regularity, but also its spaces for harmonic improvisation.*

*In the early- to mid-twentieth century, many music educators were concerned with creating engaging and effective approaches to teaching music fundamentals. This video-article brings to life a pedagogical device from 1946 that was invented by the music theorist Victor Zuckerkandl but never produced. We demonstrate how this “small toy” can be used to learn major and minor keys, as Zuckerkandl intended, as well as intervals, modulations, and more. We also connect this device to manipulatives in mathematics education.*

### “‘Why Can’t I Just Do It Straightaway?’ Bluey, Joff Bush, and Accumulation”

*Like many kids’ TV shows,* Bluey *frequently repurposes classical music. In designing* Bluey’s *soundscape, lead composer Joff Bush has frequently favored an end-oriented approach to revealing classical themes, engaging a formal process that productively interfaces with Peter Burkholder’s (1995) idea of thematic growth via cumulative form and Mark Spicer’s (2004) extension of the concept, textural growth via accumulative form. In this video, I generalize both kinds of growth into a holistic process of accumulation, and I show how Bush and his creative team often apply this process to support* Bluey’s *narrative goals. Three analytical vignettes demonstrate how* Bluey’s *audiences are often taken on a journey of discovery in the seven to nine minutes each episode encompasses—themes are initially hinted at, gradually assembled, and finally revealed in their full splendor at the episode’s narrative climax.*

### "Music as Movement in Signed Song: Analyzing Rosa Lee Timm’s 'River Song'"

*Music created and performed primarily in a visual-kinesthetic or tactile modality, such as signed music, presents important challenges for our existing methodologies and paradigms in the field of music theory. The existence of music that does not necessarily involve sounds prompts us to reconceptualize music in terms of organized movement, and to consider how musical parameters such as vocal quality, melody, and rhythm can emerge in a visual-kinesthetic musical medium. This video considers these parameters through a detailed analysis of the original signed song “River Song,” composed and performed by Rosa Lee Timm. The video uses music analysis and video interviews with Timm to reveal the meaning of a purely signed piece of music.*
